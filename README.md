This is an arduino sketch for prop simulation used in Airsoft/Paintball/Wargames. It can function as a game controller but also as a bomb that must be activated/deactivated for the objective to be completed.

Features:

* 3 Game modes
 - Search & Destroy
 - Sabotage
 - Domination
* Passcode arm/disarm
* Sound (not high quality itÂ´s just an arduino)
* Relay / Mosfet for external siren/light
