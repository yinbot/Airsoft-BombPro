SoftI2CMaster
=============

Software I2C Arduino library

This is a very fast and light-weight software I2C-master library
written in assembler, which is based on Peter Fleury's software
I2C library http://homepage.hispeed.ch/peterfleury/avr-software.html
. It can use any pins on any AVR chip to drive the SDA and SCL lines.

It assumes a single master and does not support bus arbitration. It
allows for clock stretching by slave devices and also can detect lock
ups of the I2C bus, i.e., if the SCL line is held low indefinitely.

Even on 1MHz systems, you can get a transfer speed of 40 kbit/sec, so
you can use it to interface with SMbus devices.
